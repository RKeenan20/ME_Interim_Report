Falls are one of the leading causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries especially for elderly people in today's society. Quick response is vital to reducing the long-term effects on the victim physically, emotionally and mentally. Falls have been one of leading cause of injuries across all age groups placing a strain on health and financial systems around the world. \\
As a result, an efficient, accurate and cost effective detection system needs to be implemented for a variety of environments. Over 50\% of falls for the 65+ age group (1/3 experience a fall at least once a year) occur in their home so a solution that is \textbf{cheap, accurate, privacy-focused} and \textbf{easily installed} is needed. \\
Personally, I have seen the effects falls can have on an elderly person and the fear induced in a fall victim post-treatment can deem them unable to live alone again. \\
There are a number of solutions on the commercial market today which can be divided into a broad number of categories: Wearables, Visual, Ambient Environment. Products on the market in these categories include the Apple Watch, cameras, accelerometer belts, floor vibration sensors, infrared devices and many more. As summarised in my Interim Presentation, each of these has their disadvantages. \textbf{Privacy} is a key issue that needs to be addressed across the world in the next decade. Therefore, it was a key aim of my project to keep it as privacy oriented as possible. Many of the current solutions on the market suffer from privacy issues especially in such a sensitive environment as somebody's home. Many of these off the shelf solutions require direct Line of Sight (LOS) to the person in the room to detect a fall. No obstacles can be in the way of the detection apparatus or a fall may not be detected by the system. This is especially useless in a busy household environment with many obstacles. All of these existing solutions are quite expensive to buy and implement such as the Apple Watch, specialist cameras and Man-Down sensors. Another issue arises from the wearable nature of a lot of these devices. Elderly people are not inclined to wear them as they hinder them from daily activities and can feel like a chore to keep them charged/around their neck/waist all day. This results in a lot of people refusing to wear them which is not helpful when health services around the world believe they are wearing them. They also require high processing power as the calculations and classification operations needed for the sheer amount of data recovered in any of these fall detection experiments. \\
Therefore, I propose a Wi-Fi based solution which could utilise freely available commercial off the shelf Wi-Fi network cards and Access Points and provide a cheap, highly accurate and non-intrusive fall detection system for the home and other environments.
